   ```

2. **Customer Journey**:
   ```
   Registration → Verification → Agreement Creation → Payment → Service
   ```

3. **Agreement Processing**:
   ```
   Creation → Validation → Payment Setup → Document Generation → Management
   ```

4. **Financial Processing**:
   ```
   Transaction → Validation → Recording → Reporting → Analysis
   ```
