npm run type-check
```

## Functionality Testing

### Test Queries

- [ ] Test error handling for invalid queries

### Test Mutations
- [ ] Create traffic fine
- [ ] Update traffic fine status
- [ ] Delete traffic fine
- [ ] Create legal case
- [ ] Update legal case status
- [ ] Add document to legal case

### Test Error Handling
- [ ] Simulate network errors
- [ ] Test validation errors with invalid data

## Performance Verification

- [ ] Check query caching behavior
- [ ] Verify background updates work
- [ ] Measure initial load time

## Documentation Review

- [ ] Ensure service-migration-summary.md is accurate
- [ ] Check that type-consolidation-guide.md matches implementation
- [ ] Verify legacy-service-cleanup.md is complete

## Final Verification

Run the application and perform end-to-end testing to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\khamis\coodebase rental\rental-solutions-28bf4163"
