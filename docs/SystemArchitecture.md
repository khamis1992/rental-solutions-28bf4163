# Rental Solutions System Architecture

## Overview

Rental Solutions is a comprehensive fleet management system designed to handle vehicle rentals, customer management, agreement processing, payment tracking, and various operational aspects of vehicle rental businesses. This document serves as a reference guide for developers to understand system components, their relationships, and critical paths to avoid during optimization efforts.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modern React-based frontend architecture with a Supabase backend providing database services, authentication, storage, and serverless functions.

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **State Management**: React Context API, TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage)
- **API Communication**: Supabase Client SDK
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF, pdfmake

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Interaction → React Components → Hooks → Supabase Client → Database
                                    ↓
                       Real-time updates via Subscription
                                    ↓
                       UI Updates & Notifications (Sonner)
```

## Core Business Domain Modules

## Database Schema Relationships

### Core Entity Relationships

```
Customers (profiles) ←→ Agreements (leases) ←→ Vehicles (vehicles)
         ↓                     ↓                     ↓
    CustomerNotes         Payments            Maintenance
         ↓                     ↓                     ↓
 CustomerSegments     PaymentSchedules    MaintenanceParts
```

### Payment Flow Relationships

```
Agreement (leases) → Payment Schedules → Unified Payments
                     ↓
             Overdue Payments → Legal Cases
```

### Document Relationships

```
Agreement → Agreement Documents → Document Processing Queue
   ↓
Customer → Document Analysis → Document Reminders
   ↓
Vehicle → Vehicle Documents → Document Reminders
```

## Critical System Processes

### 1. Agreement Creation Flow

1. Customer selection/creation
2. Vehicle selection (availability check)
3. Terms configuration (dates, amounts)
4. Document generation
5. Payment recording
6. Status updates

**Critical Interdependencies**:
- Vehicle status must update when assigned to agreement
- Initial payment must be recorded correctly
- Document generation needs all related entity data

### 2. Payment Processing Flow

1. Payment schedule generation (monthly/custom)
2. Payment recording (manual/import)
3. Receipt generation
4. Status updates
5. Late fee calculation (when applicable)

**Critical Interdependencies**:
- Late fee calculation depends on accurate date processing
- Agreement status depends on payment status
- Receipt generation needs payment verification

### 3. Vehicle Assignment Process

1. Vehicle availability check
2. Previous agreement closure (if reassigning)
3. New agreement creation
4. Status updates for vehicle and agreements

**Critical Interdependencies**:
- Vehicle can only be in one active agreement
- Previous agreement must be properly closed/archived
- Status synchronization between entities

### 4. Report Generation Process

1. Data aggregation from multiple tables
2. Calculation of metrics and KPIs
3. PDF/document generation
4. Distribution/storage

**Critical Interdependencies**:
- Report accuracy depends on data consistency
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Proper handling of different date ranges

## State Management Approach

The system uses a combination of:

1. **React Query (TanStack Query)** for server state:
   - Data fetching, caching, and synchronization
   - Optimistic updates for responsive UI
   - Background refetching for data freshness

2. **React Context** for global application state:
   - User authentication state
   - UI preferences
   - Application-wide settings

3. **Component State** for local UI state:
   - Form inputs
   - UI toggles
   - Local component behavior

## Error Handling Strategy

The system implements a layered approach to error handling:

1. **UI Level**: Toast notifications via Sonner
2. **Query Level**: Error states in TanStack Query hooks
3. **API Level**: Error handling in Supabase clients
4. **Database Level**: Constraints and triggers

Key error paths are logged to help with debugging and monitoring.

## Performance Considerations

### Database Query Optimization

- Avoid nested relationship queries when possible
- Use indexes for frequently filtered fields
- Implement pagination for large datasets

### React Component Optimization

- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Virtualization for large lists
- Code splitting for route-based loading

### Critical Performance Paths

1. Agreement list with complex filters
2. Payment history for long-term agreements
3. Dashboard with multiple data aggregations
4. Document generation process

## Security Considerations

### Data Access Controls

- Row-Level Security in Supabase tables
- Role-based access control in frontend
- Validation of all user inputs

### Sensitive Data Handling

- Secure document storage
- Proper handling of payment information
- Compliance with data protection regulations

## System Integration Points

### External Systems

1. **Payment Processing**:
   - Unified payments table serves as integration point

2. **Document Generation**:
   - Template system with variable placeholders
   - Processing queue for asynchronous generation

3. **Email Notifications**:
   - Templates stored in email_templates
   - Queue system for delivery tracking

### Internal Integration Points

1. **Financial Reporting** depends on:
   - Agreement data
   - Payment records
   - Vehicle utilization

2. **Customer Status** depends on:
   - Payment history
   - Agreement compliance
   - Legal case status

## Optimization Guidelines

When performing system optimizations, consider these guidelines to avoid breaking functionality:

### 1. Database Modifications

- **Always** maintain existing column names and types in critical tables
- When adding indexes, verify query execution plans
- Test any schema changes against the full dataset

### 2. Component Refactoring

- Maintain the same prop interface for widely used components
- Preserve event handling patterns and naming conventions
- Test refactored components with all possible state variations

### 3. Hook Optimization

- Keep return signatures consistent when refactoring hooks
- Verify optimized data fetching with real-world data volumes
- Test error paths and edge cases

### 4. API Changes

- Maintain backward compatibility for existing endpoints
- Version any incompatible API changes
- Update all consuming components when changing response structures

## Testing Strategy

The system should be tested at multiple levels:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and components
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and data flows
3. **E2E Tests**: Critical business flows like agreement creation
4. **Performance Tests**: Data-intensive operations

## Development Workflow

When implementing new features or optimizations:

1. Review this documentation to understand dependencies
2. Create focused components and hooks
3. Update only necessary parts of the state management
4. Add appropriate error handling
5. Test with representative data volumes
6. Document any new integration points
