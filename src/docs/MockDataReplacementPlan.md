# Mock Data Replacement Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the strategy and implementation plan for transitioning from mock data to real data in our Fleet Management System. The plan includes a phased approach to minimize disruption while ensuring data integrity and system stability.

## Current State Assessment
- **Mock Data Components**: Vehicle data, customer profiles, maintenance records, payment history, and reports currently use mock data.
- **API Integration**: Several components are already using API calls but with mock data responses.
- **UI Components**: All UI components are built to handle the data format from the mock services.

## Data Dependencies
1. Vehicle data is foundational and needed by most other components
2. Customer profiles are referenced by leases, payments, and communications
3. Lease agreements link vehicles to customers and generate financial transactions
4. Maintenance records reference vehicles and sometimes vendors
5. Reports depend on all other data sources

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Preparation & Core Entities âœ…
- [x] **Database Schema Validation**: Ensure the database schema matches our requirements
- [x] **Core Entities Setup**: Setup vehicles, customers, maintenance records in the database
- [x] **Data Relationships**: Establish proper relationships between entities
- [x] **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API requests
- [x] **Real-time Updates**: Ensure real-time updates for vehicle status changes

### Phase 2: Transactional Data & Relationships
- [ ] **Lease Agreements**: Connect vehicles to customers through lease agreements
- [ ] **Payment Processing**: Implement real payment data handling
- [ ] **Maintenance Scheduling**: Connect maintenance records to vehicles and service providers
- [ ] **Financial Calculations**: Ensure financial calculations are accurate with real data

### Phase 3: Reporting & Analytics
- [ ] **Dashboard Updates**: Reconfigure dashboards to use real-time data
- [ ] **Report Generation**: Update report generation logic to query actual database
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Add caching for frequently accessed reports
- [ ] **Historical Data**: Implement strategies for handling historical data

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Testing
- [ ] **Notifications**: Configure notification system to work with real data events
- [ ] **Search Functionality**: Optimize search for real database structure
- [ ] **End-to-end Testing**: Comprehensive testing with real data
- [ ] **Performance Tuning**: Final performance optimization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- Use Supabase for database storage and realtime updates
- Implement proper indexing for frequent queries
- Setup foreign key constraints for data integrity

### API Layer
- Migrate from mock API handlers to real API calls
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Add request validation for all API endpoints

### Frontend Components
- Update components to handle loading states gracefully
- Implement error boundaries for API failures
- Add data validation to form submissions

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- **Data Loss Risk**: Implement regular backups and transaction logging
- **Performance Impact**: Gradually roll out changes and monitor performance
- **UI Inconsistencies**: Comprehensive testing of all UI components with real data
- **Downtime Concerns**: Implement changes during off-peak hours

## Success Metrics
- All components function correctly with real data
- System performance meets or exceeds previous benchmarks
- Reduced error rates in data processing
- Positive user feedback on system reliability

## Rollback Plan
- Maintain dual capability to use mock or real data during transition
- Document all changes with version control
- Prepare quick-rollback scripts for critical failures

## Maintenance & Future Improvements
- Regularly audit data quality and integrity
- Plan for periodic schema evolution
- Document all data structures and relationships
