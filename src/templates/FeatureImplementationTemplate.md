## 6. Implementation Approach

For each module, we'll follow this implementation strategy:

1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Design database tables and relationships
   - Implement data validation
   - Create RLS policies for security

2. **API Development**
   - Create CRUD operations for each entity
   - Implement business logic
   - Add validation and error handling

3. **UI Component Development**
   - Develop reusable UI components
   - Create page layouts
   - Implement forms and workflows

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Test module integration points
   - Verify workflow consistency
   - Validate data accuracy

5. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Validate against user requirements
   - Collect feedback
   - Make necessary adjustments

## 7. Next Steps: Authentication & User Management Implementation

Next immediate steps:

1. Design user roles and permissions
2. Create database schema for users and roles
3. Implement Supabase Auth integration
4. Develop UI components for auth flows
5. Add role-based access control to existing vehicle management

## 8. Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Integration complexity between modules | High | Implement clear interfaces and thorough testing |
| Data consistency across modules | High | Use database constraints and validation |
| Performance issues with growing data | Medium | Design for scalability and implement caching |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Implement proper authentication and authorization |
| User adoption challenges | Medium | Focus on UX and provide comprehensive documentation |

## 9. Success Metrics
